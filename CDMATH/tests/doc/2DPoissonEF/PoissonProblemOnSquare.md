## The Poisson problem on the square

We consider the following Poisson problem with Dirichlet boundary conditions

$$
\left\{\begin{array}{c}
-\Delta u=f \textrm{ on } \Omega\\
u=0 \textrm{ on } \partial\Omega
\end{array}\right.
$$

on the square domain $\Omega= [0,1]\times [0,1]$ with 
$$f=2\pi^2 sin(\pi x) sin(\pi y).$$  
The unique solution of the problem is
$$
u=sin(\pi x) sin(\pi y).
$$

The Poisson equation is a particular case of the diffusion problem
$$
-\nabla\cdot(K\vec\nabla u)=f
$$
and the associated diffusion flux is
$$
F(u)=K\nabla u.
$$

We are in the particular case where $K=1$.
