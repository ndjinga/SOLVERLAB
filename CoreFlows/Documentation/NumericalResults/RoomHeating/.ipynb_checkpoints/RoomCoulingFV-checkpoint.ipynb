    "&nbsp; &nbsp; The goal of this work is to determine the best position for a radiator in a room with regard to the window position in order to optimize the room temperature. The problem amounts to solving the Laplace equation with Dirichlet boundary conditions in a cuboid geometry. After meshing the room with tetrahedra or cubes, we use finite volume method to compare three different radiator positions.  \n",
    "&nbsp; &nbsp; We start by recalling the existence theory for the Laplace equation with smooth Dirichlet boundary conditions. We however keep in mind that the application we have in mind has a discontinuous boundary condition.\n",
