The stationary diffusion equation
---------------------------------

$$
 -\lambda\triangle T = \Phi+\lambda_{sf}(T_f-T)
$$

where
- $T$ the main unknown is the solid temperature field
- $\lambda$ is the solid thermal conductivity possibly set by the user (default value is 1)
- $\Phi$ is the heat source term possibly set by the user (default value is 0)
- $\lambda_{sf}$ is the fluid-solid heat transfer coefficient set by the user (default value is 0)
- $T_f$ is the fluid temperature field provided by the user

See the [Stationary diffusion equation page](StationaryDiffusionEq.md)

The diffusion equation	
----------------------

$$
 \partial_t T =d\triangle T +\frac{ \Phi+\lambda_{sf}(T_f-T)}{\rho c_p}
$$

where
- $T$ the main unknown is the rod temperature field
- $\rho$ is the rod density assumed constant (default value 10000)
- $c_p$ is the rod specific heat, provided by the user and assumed constant (default value 300)
- $d=\frac{\lambda}{\rho c_p}$ is the rod diffusivity  (default value 5/(10000*300))
- $\lambda_{sf}$ is the fluid-rod heat transfer coefficient provided by the user (default value 0)
- $\Phi$ is the heat source term if explicitely known (default value 0)
- $T_f$ is the fluid temperature field provided by the user

The transport equation	
----------------------
 
$$

$$

where

- $h$ the main unknown is the fluid enthalpy field
- $\vec{u}$ is the constant transport velocity
- $\Phi$ is the heat source term if explicitely known
- $T_s$ is the rod temperature field provided by the user
- $T=T_0+\frac{H-H_0}{c_p}$ is the fluid temperature field
- $\lambda_{sf}$ is the fluid-rod heat transfer coefficient provided by the user
